# Beresheet Stimulation

## Introduction
This repository contains a simulation of the landing sequence of the Beresheet spacecraft on the lunar surface. The goal of this simulation is to provide a tool for researchers and enthusiasts to explore the dynamics of the spacecraft during landing and to test different landing strategies.

## Features
The simulation includes the following features:

 * A PID controller for controlling the spacecraft's velocity during landing
 * Realistic physics simulations of the spacecraft and the lunar surface
 * Adjustable parameters for the spacecraft's initial velocity, altitude, and other landing parameters
 * Results output to a JTable for easy analysis

## Getting Started
You will need to have Java installed on your computer. Once you have java installed, you can clone this repository and build it with costumize idea and run the beresheet_sim main.
